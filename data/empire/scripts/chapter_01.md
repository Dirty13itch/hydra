# Chapter 1: The Shattered Crown

## Scene 1: Throne Room - Night

[Background: A once-magnificent throne room now in ruins. Moonlight streams through broken windows, illuminating dust motes and debris. The throne sits askew, its velvet torn.]

[Music: Melancholic strings, slow and haunting]

[Enter SERAPHINA]

*The queen moves through the shadows like a ghost, her tattered gown trailing across the broken floor. Her eyes hold a distant, fractured look.*

**Seraphina** (pensive): "They used to dance here. Do you remember? The chandeliers blazed like captured stars..."

*She pauses, head tilting as if listening to something only she can hear.*

**Seraphina** (fearful): "No. No, I won't listen tonight. Tonight I am still... mostly myself."

[Enter MIRA]

*Mira rushes in, lantern in hand, her face creased with worry.*

**Mira** (concerned): "My queen! You shouldn't be wandering alone. The castle isn't safe after dark."

**Seraphina** (neutral): "Safe? Was it ever safe, Mira? Even before... before he..."

*Her voice trails off, one hand rising to touch the scar on her temple.*

**Mira** (loving): "Come back to your chambers. I've prepared your tea. The one that helps you sleep without dreams."

**Seraphina** (sad): "Dreams. He visits me in dreams, you know. Lysander. Always apologizing. Always explaining why he had to break me."

*Mira's expression hardens at the name.*

**Mira** (angry): "That monster deserves no space in your thoughts, Your Majesty."

**Seraphina** (determined): "Monster? Perhaps. But he was mine once. And I... I was whole."

*She straightens, and for a moment, the madness clears from her eyes. She looks every inch a queen.*

**Seraphina** (determined): "Summon the Council, Mira. What remains of them. It's time the Northern Reaches remembered they still have a queen."

## Scene 2: Council Chamber - Morning

[Background: A smaller room, better preserved. A round table with maps and documents. Grey morning light filters through narrow windows.]

[Music: Tense, low drums]

[Enter SERAPHINA, MIRA]

*Seraphina sits at the head of the table, Mira standing behind her. Two elderly advisors and a young knight occupy other chairs.*

**Seraphina** (neutral): "Reports. What of our borders?"

*The advisors exchange nervous glances. This is the most lucid they've seen the queen in months.*

**Mira** (determined): "Speak freely. The queen commands it."

**Seraphina** (pensive): "They fear me. They fear what I might become mid-sentence."

*A ghost of a smile crosses her lips.*

**Seraphina** (happy): "Perhaps that fear is useful. Let our enemies wonder too."

## Scene 3: Castle Balcony - Sunset

[Background: A crumbling balcony overlooking what was once a beautiful garden, now overgrown and wild. The sunset paints everything in shades of crimson and gold.]

[Music: Bittersweet melody, violin solo]

*Seraphina stands at the balcony's edge, dangerously close to the broken railing.*

**Seraphina** (sad): "Do you ever wonder, Mira, if the cure might be worse than the curse?"

**Mira** (fearful): "My queen, please step back from the edge..."

**Seraphina** (neutral): "I'm not going to jump. Though some nights... the voice suggests it."

*She turns, her violet eyes catching the last light.*

**Seraphina** (determined): "But I refuse. I am broken, not defeated. There is a difference."

**Mira** (loving): "You are the strongest person I know, Your Majesty."

**Seraphina** (pensive): "Strength? Or stubbornness? Perhaps madness itself keeps me alive, too fragmented to properly despair."

*She laughs - a haunting, musical sound.*

**Seraphina** (happy): "Tomorrow we ride for the Eastern Temple. If answers exist anywhere, they hide in those ancient halls."

**Mira** (surprised): "The Temple? But the journey... the dangers..."

**Seraphina** (determined): "Are nothing compared to the danger of remaining as I am. I will be whole again, Mira. Or I will break trying."
